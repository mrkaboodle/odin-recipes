    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These au gratin potatoes are one of my favorite — I consider it a special occasion every time I make them! The creamy cheese sauce and tender potatoes in this classic French dish make a delicious flavor combination. Serve potatoes au gratin with a roast pork loin or beef tenderloin, alongside a green salad.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Potatoes:</strong> This recipe starts with thinly sliced Russet potatoes. You can substitute Yukon gold, if you like.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion:</strong> Slice one onion into rings to layer with the potatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> These creamy au gratin potatoes are simply seasoned with just salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter and flour:</strong> The cheese sauce starts with a roux made with butter and all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Make sure you slowly whisk in the milk to create the creamiest consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Because isn't everything better with shredded Cheddar?</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium russet potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, sliced into rings</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1-quart casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Layer 1/2 of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; season with salt and pepper. Layer onion slices over top, then top with with remaining potatoes. Season again with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Gradually whisk in flour and salt and cook, whisking constantly until raw flour flavor has cooked off, about 1 minute. Gradually add milk, about 1/4 cup at a time, whisking well after each addition to incorporate; the gradual addition and whisking of milk will help avoid lumps in your sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in cheese all at once; continue stirring until melted, 30 to 60 seconds. Pour cheese sauce over the potatoes, and cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and sauce is bubbly, about 1 ½ hours.</li>
    </ol>
